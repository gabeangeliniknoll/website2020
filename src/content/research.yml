        - title: A May-type spectral sequence for topological Hochschild homology
          description: We construct a spectral sequence for higher topological Hochschild homology associated to a multiplicative filtration of a commutative ring spectrum. In particular, we show that the Whitehead tower of a commutative ring spectrum can be built as a multiplicative filtered commutative ring spectrum. We use this spectral sequence to give a bound on topological Hochshcild homology of a connective commutative ring spectrum.

          description: We give conditions for Morava K-theory to commute with certain homotopy limits with an eye towards applications to topoligical periodic cyclic homology and algebraic K-theory. As our application, we a version of Mitchell's theorem for truncated Brown-Peterson spectra.

          description: We compute Morava K-theory of topological periodic cyclic homology and topological negative cyclic homology of the Thom spectra y(n). This gives evidence for a version of the red-shift conjecture for topological periodic cyclic homology at all chromatic heights.

        - title: Detecting the beta family in iterated algebraic K-theory of finite fields
          description: I prove that the beta family is detected in iterated algebraic K-theory of finite fields and consequently iterated algebraic K-theory of the integers. This gives evidence for a higher chromatic height version of the Lichtenbaum conjecture, which I call the Greek-letter-family red-shift conjecture, after the red-shift conjecture of Ausoni-Rognes.

        - title: The Segal Conjecture for Topological Hochschild Homology of the Ravenel spectra X(n) and T(n)
          description: We solve the homotopy limit problem for topological Hochschild homology of Ravenel's spectra X(n) with respect to all cyclic groups of order a power of p. This implies that, after p-completion, topological negative cyclic homology and topological periodic cyclic homology of X(n) are homotopy equivalent.

          description: We give a description of the Mackey functor homotopy groups of Real topological Hochschild homology of noncommutative rings with anti-involution in terms of Witt vectors for rings with anti-involution. We also provide a Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm model for Real topological Hochshild homology.
